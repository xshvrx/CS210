# Homework 3: Movie Recommendations
# Overview
# In this assignment, you'll implement a prototype movie
# recommendation program by filling in the function implementations in
# the given hw3.py template file.

# Make sure you implement your functions in hw3.py. Do not implement
# the functions in this notebook. They will be imported here from hw3.py, 
# so you can test them directly. 

# You can run your tests on the given input files, but you're
# encouraged to make your own test files as well, to make sure that
# you cover the various paths of logic in your functions. You don't
# have to submit any of your test files.

# You may assume that all parameter values given to your functions
# will be valid. Also, in any function that requires the returned
# values to be sorted or ranked, ties may be broken arbitrarily
# between equal values.

# You may assume that input files will be correctly formatted, and
# data types will be as expected.

# For all rating computations, do not round up (or otherwise modify)
# the rating unless otherwise specified.

# Input Files
# Ratings file: A text file that contains movie ratings. Each line has the id of the user who rated the movie, the id of the movie, and its rating (range 0-5 inclusive). A movie can have multiple ratings from different users. A user can rate multiple movies but can rate a particular movie only once. 

# Movies file: A text file that contains movies and their genres. Each line has a movie id, the name of the movie, the year it was released, and the genre of the movie (e.g, Action, Drama, etc.). 

# There are sample movies and ratings files provided on Codebench. 

# Part 1: Reading Data
# import hw3
# from hw3 import read_movies_data, read_ratings_data
# 1.1 (8 points) Read Movies File
# Write a function read_movies_data(f) that takes in a movies file and returns a pandas DataFrame, where the index is the movie id and the columns are "title", "year", and "genre" (in that order). 

# movies_df = read_movies_data("moviesSample.txt")
# assert movies_df.shape == (9, 3)
# assert movies_df.iloc[2, 2] == "Comedy"
# assert movies_df.loc[6, "title"] == "Heat"
# assert all(movies_df.columns == ["title", "year", "genre"])
# assert list(movies_df.index) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10]
# 1.2 (8 points) Read Ratings File
# Write a function read_ratings_data(f) that takes in a ratings
# file name and returns a dictionary. The dictionary should have
# the movie id as key, and the corresponding list of ratings as value.

# movie_ratings = read_ratings_data("ratingsSample.csv")
# assert sum(movie_ratings[5]) == 24
# Part 2: Processing Data
# from hw3 import get_movie, create_genre_dict, calculate_average_rating
# 2.1 (8 points) Genre Dictionary
# Write a function create_genre_dict(df) which takes a movies DataFrame as a parameter and returns a dictionary with each genre as a key and a list of movie ids as values. 

# Example: 

# {
#     "Adventure": [1, 2, 8],
#     "Comedy": [3, 4, 5],
#     "Action": [6, 9, 10]
# }
# genre_dict = create_genre_dict(movies_df)
# 2.2 (8 points) Average Rating
# Write a function calculate_average_rating which takes as input a ratings dictionary like that created in Part 1.2 and a movies DataFrame of the kind created in Part 1.1. The function should return a pandas Series where the index corresponds to the movie id and the value is the average of all the ratings for the movie. 

# avg_ratings = calculate_average_rating(movie_ratings, movies_df)
# assert avg_ratings.loc[3] == 4.0
# Part 3: Recommendations
# from hw3 import get_popular_movies, filter_movies, get_popular_in_genre
# from hw3 import get_genre_rating, get_movie_of_the_year
# 3.1 (8 points) Popularity Based
# In services such as Netflix and Spotify, you often see
# recommendations with the heading "Popular movies" or "Trending top
# 10".

# Write a function get_popular_movies that takes as parameters a pandas Series
# of movie-to-average rating (as created in Part 2.2) and an integer $n$ 
# (default should be 10). 
# The function should return a
# pandas Series (movie_id:average rating, same structure as input) of top $n$ movies based on the average ratings. If there
# are fewer than $n$ movies, it should return all movies in order of top
# average ratings. The Series should be sorted in descending order by average rating.

# pop_movies = get_popular_movies(avg_ratings, 4)
# assert pop_movies.is_monotonic_decreasing
# assert set(pop_movies.index) == {6, 5, 3, 1}
# 3.2 (8 point) Threshold Rating
# Write a function filter_movies that takes as parameters a pandas Series of
# movie-to-average rating (same as for the popularity based
# function above), and a threshold rating with default value of 3. The
# function should filter movies based on the threshold rating, and
# return a dictionary with same structure as the input. For example,
# if the threshold rating is 3.5, the returned dictionary should have
# only those movies from the input whose average rating is equal to or
# greater than 3.5.

# Example: 

# [In]: filter_movies(avg_ratings, 3.2)

# [Out]: 
# 1    3.833333
# 2    3.416667

# good_movies = filter_movies(avg_ratings, 3.2)
# assert good_movies.shape[0] == 6
# assert all(good_movies.values >= 3.2)
# 3.3 (8 points) Popularity & genre based
# In most recommendation systems, genre of the movie/song/book plays
# an important role. Often features like popularity, genre, artist are
# combined to present recommendations to a user.

# Write a function get_popular_in_genre which takes as parameters a genre, a genre-to-movies dictionary (as created in 2.1), a pandas Series of movie-to-average rating (as created in 2.2) and an integer $n$ (default 5), and returns the top $n$ movies for the given genre. The return should be a Series of movie-to-average rating that make the cut, i.e., the same format as the input. If there are fewer than $n$ movies, all movies for the genre are returned, in decreasing order by average rating. 

# [In]: get_popular_in_genre("Adventure", genre_dict, avg_ratings, 2)

# assert list(pop_in_genre.index) == [1, 2]
# assert pop_in_genre.is_monotonic_decreasing
# 3.4 (8 points) Genre Ratings
# One important analysis for the content platforms is to determine
# ratings by genre.

# Write a function get_genre_rating that takes the same parameters as
# get_popular_in_genre above, except for $n$, and returns the average
# rating of the movies in the given genre.

# [In]: get_genre_rating("Action", genre_dict, avg_ratings)
# [Out]: 3.527777777777778
# get_genre_rating("Action", genre_dict, avg_ratings)
# 3.527777777777778
# genre_rating = get_genre_rating("Action", genre_dict, avg_ratings)
# assert genre_rating > 3.525
# assert genre_rating < 3.53
# 3.5 (8 points) Movie of the Year
# Write a function get_movie_of_the_year which takes as parameters a year, a movie-to-average rating Series (as created in 2.2), and a movies DataFrame (as created in 1.1)
# and returns the title of the movie with the highest average rating 
# for the given year. 

# [In]: get_movie_of_the_year(1995, avg_ratings, movies_df)
# [Out]: 'Heat'
# assert get_movie_of_the_year(1995, avg_ratings, movies_df) == 'Heat'
# Part 4: User Focused
# from hw3 import read_user_ratings, get_user_genre, recommend_movies
# 4.1 (8 points) User Ratings
# Read the ratings file to return a user-to-movies dictionary that maps user ID to the associated movies
# and the corresponding ratings. Write a function named read_user_ratings for this, with the ratings
# file as the parameter.

# For example:

# {
#     u1: [(m1, r1), (m2, r2)],
#     u2: [(m3, r3), (m8, r8)]
# }
# where u1 is a user ID, m1 is a movie ID, and r1 is the corresponding rating. 

# user_movies = read_user_ratings("ratingsSample.csv")
# assert user_movies[42] == [(3, 4.0)]
# 4.2 (10 points) User Genre
# Write a function get_user_genre that takes as parameters a user id, the user-to-movies dictionary
# (as created in Part 4.1 above), and the movies DataFrame (as created in Part 1.1), and returns
# the top genre that the user likes based on the userâ€™s ratings. Here, the top genre for the user will be
# determined by taking the average rating of the movies genre-wise that the user has rated. If multiple
# genres have the same highest ratings for the user, return any one of genres (arbitrarily) as the top
# genre.

# [In]: get_user_genre(6, user_movies, movies_df)
# [Out]: 'Comedy'
# get_user_genre(6, user_movies, movies_df)
# 'Comedy'
# user_genre = get_user_genre(42, user_movies, movies_df)
# assert user_genre == "Comedy"
# 4.3 (10 points) User Recommendations
# Recommend 3 most popular (highest average rating) movies from the userâ€™s top genre that the user
# has not yet rated. Write a function called recommend_movies for this, that takes as parameters a user id,
# the user-to-movies dictionary (as created in Part 4.1 above), the movies DataFrame (as created
# in Part 1.1), and the movie-to-average rating Series (as created in Part 2.2). The function should
# return a pandas Series of movie-to-average rating, sorted in decreasing order by rating. If fewer than 3 movies make the cut, then return all
# the movies that make the cut in order of top average ratings.

# [In]: recommend_movies(6, user_movies, movies_df, avg_ratings)
# [Out]: 
# 3    4.0
# 5    4.0
# 4    2.5
# Name: avg_ratings, dtype: float64
# recommend_movies(6, user_movies, movies_df, avg_ratings)
# Series([], dtype: float64)
