# Write a program that reads words from a file (filename given
# as a string parameter) and prints the occurance of each word(case insensitive). And print the words in alphabetical order.

# For example, if the file contains text

# Love is free
# free is love
# then the function should print

# free:2
# is:2
# love:2

def count_word(filename):
    counts = {}
    
    with open(filename, 'r') as file:
        for line in file:
            # Split the line into words
            words = line.strip().split()
            for word in words:
                # Convert the word to lowercase
                word_lower = word.lower()
                counts[word_lower] = counts.get(word_lower, 0) + 1
    # Sort the words alphabetically
    sorted_words = sorted(counts.items(), key=lambda x: x[0])

    for word, count in sorted_words:
        print(f"{word}:{count}")
# Your output should look like this
count_word('words2.txt')
