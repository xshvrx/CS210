# Write a program that reads words passing from a string parameter and create a dictionary mapping last letters to the number of words ending with that letter.

# For example, the string is 'apple banana orange grape cherry', the program will
# out put a dictionary fruitName that

# print(fruitName)
# will give us output

{'e': 3, 'a': 1, 'y': 1}

    word_list = words.split()

    for word in word_list:
        # Get the last letter of each word
        last_letter = word[-1].lower()
        # Check if the last letter is a valid alphabet letter
        if last_letter.isalpha():
            # Update the dictionary with the last letter count
            counts[last_letter] = counts.get(last_letter, 0) + 1
